# Conditionals Cheat Sheet
# In earlier videos, we took a look at some of the built-in Python operators that allow us to compare values, and some logical operators we can use to combine values. We also learned how to use operators in if-else-elif blocks. 

# It’s a lot to learn but, with practice, it gets easier to remember it all. In the meantime, this handy cheat sheet gives you all the information you need at a glance. 

# Comparison operators
# a == b: a is equal to b

# a != b: a is different than b

# a < b: a is smaller than b

# a <= b: a is smaller or equal to b

# a > b: a is bigger than b

# a >= b: a is bigger or equal to b

# Logical operators
# a and b: True if both a and b are True. False otherwise.

# a or b: True if either a or b or both are True. False if both are False.

# not a: True if a is False, False if a is True.

# Branching blocks

# In Python, we branch our code using if, else and elif. This is the branching syntax:

# if condition1:
# 	if-block
# elif condition2:
# 	elif-block
# else:
# 	else-block

# Remember: The if-block will be executed if condition1 is True. The elif-block will be executed if condition1 is False and condition2 is True. The else block will be executed when all the specified conditions are false.

#   while n % 2 == 0:
#     if n == 0 :
#       break;

# # If after dividing by two the number is 1, it's a power of two

#   return False
